                We went to a new location this year in the
                beautiful hills, close to the south entrance to
                Yosemite, at Sugar Pine Christian Camp in
                Oakhurst. Change can be difficult; however, being
                surrounded by the beauty of God’s creation we
                immediately felt at "home," beginning our week
                surrounded with the beauty that God provided for
                us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our morning prayers, Vespers, and Liturgy services
                were held at our campfire site, along with many
                evenings of wonderful skits, discussions, and of
                course s’mores. All activities were held outside,
                whether we were playing games, doing Arts and
                Crafts or studying the Feast Days of the Theotokos.
                We offered many new activities this year such as
                archery, BB gun targets, canoeing, paddle boarding,
                a ropes course with a zip line, a train ride and
                hikes. We were blessed to have 13 campers and 3
                adult volunteers from our church.

              <p>
                <em>"The ropes course and zipline was my favorite. It

                the sunshine filter through the trees during
                morning prayers."</em><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Josefine
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>"Learning the Theotokos at the age of 3 walked up
                the stairs to the High Priest"</em><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–Lily
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>"Not sure anyone will say anything different than
                ‘Glop’ as my favorite meal."</em><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Josefine

                  that you are on the very brink of perdition. He will never

                Tragic fire at our Mother Parish
              </h2>

              <div className="article-body" style={{ marginBottom: '32px' }}>
                <p>
                  On July 12, tragedy struck the Holy Myrrhbearing
                  Women in West Sacramento when an electrical
                  fire broke out in the church. The fire destroyed
                  the interior of the church and has likely
                  compromised the structure itself. Adding to the
                  difficulty, the parish’s insurance will cover only
                  a portion of what is needed to rebuild.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Holy Myrrhbearers is the oldest Orthodox parish
                  in Sacramento. The church temple was
                  constructed in 1925 through the labors and
                  sacrifices of the parishioners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the midst of the recent tragedy, God’s mercy
                  and care is evident. Three icons survived the fire
                  unharmed: the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God,
                  St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and St. John of
                  Shanghai and San Francisco. Many parish
                  communities have responded with help,
                  including Holy Cross. To date Holy Cross has
                  donated Liturgical items to aid in resuming
                  Divine services, and parishioners have
                  contributed over $6,000 toward reconstruction
                  efforts. Further donations can be made directly
                  through the website at:&nbsp;<br/>
